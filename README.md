=====================
normalizedAxis.js is a highcharts extension to provide a custom button to normalize and denormalize a chart's yAxis. 
This works for a multiple yAxis chart.When normalized, the yAxis are merged together into a percentage axi and the normalized values are calculated per series dividing the current value with the max for the series.
